    <h1>Aarya Bhatia</h1>
    <br>

    <p>I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science
    from the University of Illinois, at Urbana-Champaign. I will graduate 
    in May 2024 and work full-time as a software developer.</p>

    <p>I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems programming. I
    am proficient in C, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL and Bash languages. I have
    worked with several web frameworks like Node.js and Flask.py.</p>

    <p>I am dedicated to problem-solving and being the most efficient version
    of myself. That's why I trained myself to use a workflow of neovim, tmux
    and i3 on Arch linux.</p>

    <p>I have interned at multiple companies, from startups in education and AI
    to Amazon, where I worked on the Goodreads team in the Bay Area. Presently,
    I am a course assistant at my university in CS340 where we teach computer
    systems from a practical perspectve.</p>

    <p>I grew up in India and now live in the US. I am also a training musician
    with my primary instrument being the electric guitar. I have been playing
    for over a decade. For fun, I also enjoy playing sports like badminton and
    hiking.</p>
