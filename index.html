        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I am a 22 year old software engineer working at Amazon. I
          recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics and
          Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems
          programming. I am proficient in Linux and C/C++, Python, Go,
          JavaScript and SQL. I have worked with several frameworks including
          Express and Flask. I love problem-solving and being the most efficient
          version of myself. I also enjoy exploring new tools and hacking on
          tools like bspwm, neovim or tmux. Check out my collection of
          <a href="https://github.com/aarya-bhatia/scripts">scripts</a> or
          <a href="https://github.com/aarya-bhatia/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> on
          Github.
        </p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This year, I will begin working at Amazon as an SDE. I had my first
          internship with Amazon in 2023, where I worked on a React project and
          shipped several website improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was the lead course assistant at my university for 2
          years, where we taught about computer systems and C programming.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I am a trained musician and primarily play the electric guitar, since
          the last 12 years. I appreciate a wide range of musical genres,
          especially old rock hits and progressive metal artists such as Opeth
          and Porcupine Tree.
