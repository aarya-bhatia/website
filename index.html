          <p>
            Hello, I am a 22 year old software engineer working at Amazon. I
            recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics and
            Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

          <h2 class="py-2">Skills</h4>
          <p>
            I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems
            programming. I am proficient in Linux and C/C++, Python, Go,
            JavaScript and SQL. I have worked with several frameworks including
            Express and Flask. I love problem-solving and being the most
            efficient version of myself. I also enjoy exploring new tools and
            hacking on tools like bspwm, neovim or tmux. Check out my collection
            of

          <h2 class="py-2">Work Experience</h4>
          <p>
            This year, I will begin working at Amazon as an SDE. I had my first
            internship with Amazon in 2023, where I worked on a React project
            and shipped several website improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I was the lead course assistant at my university for 2
            years, where we taught about computer systems and C programming.

          <h2 class="py-2">Hobbies</h4>
          <p>
            I am a trained musician and primarily play the electric guitar,
            since the last 12 years. I appreciate a wide range of musical
            genres, especially old rock hits and progressive metal artists such
            as Opeth and Porcupine Tree.
