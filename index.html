      <p>
        I have extensive experience in full-stack web development and systems
        programming. I am proficient in Linux, C/C++, Python, Bash, Go,

      <p>
        I am excited to begin my role at Amazon as a Software Development
        Engineer this year. In 2023, I completed an internship at Amazon, where
        I worked on a React project and implemented several website
        improvements. Previously, I served as the lead course assistant at my
        university for two years, teaching computer systems and C programming.
