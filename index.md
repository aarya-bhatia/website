## Introduction

I am a student from India pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics
and Computer Science at the University of Illinois, at Urbana-Champaign. I will
graduate in 2024 and work full-time as a software developer engineer.

## Skills

I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems programming. I am
proficient in Linux and C/C++, Python, Go, JavaScript and SQL. I have worked
with several frameworks including Express and Flask. I love problem-solving and
being the most efficient version of myself. I also enjoy exploring new tools
and hacking my workflow using bspwm, vim and tmux.

## Work Experience

I am currently a course assistant at my university for CS340, where we teach
about computer systems and C programming.

I will begin working at Amazon as SDE-1 this year in the Goodreads team. I had
my first internship with Amazon in 2023 where I worked on a React project and
shipped several website improvements.

## Hobbies

I am a trained musician with my primary instrument being the electric guitar. I
have been playing guitar for more than 10 years, and appreciate a wide range of
musical genres, especially old rock and metal hits.
