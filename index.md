## Introduction

I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer
Science from the University of Illinois, at Urbana-Champaign. I grew up in
India and came to study in the US in 2020. I will graduate in May to start
working full-time as a software developer.

## Skills

I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems programming. I am
proficient in Linux and C, C++, Python, Go, Javascript and SQL. I have worked
with several frameworks like Express.js and Flask.py. I love problem-solving
and being the most efficient version of myself. My workflow uses neovim, tmux
and bspwm.

## Work Experience

Most recently, I worked as a SDE intern at Amazon, where I developed
shipped several website improvments in React.js.  Presently, I am a course
assistant at my university for CS340, where we teach about computer systems
and C programming.

## Hobbies

I am a trained musician with my primary instrument being the electric guitar. I
have been playing guitar for over a decade. For fun, I enjoy playing sports
like badminton and hiking.
