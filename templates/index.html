    <h4 class="my-2">Introduction</h4>

    <p>I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics
    and Computer Science from the University of Illinois, at
    Urbana-Champaign. I grew up in India and came to the US in 2020 for
    studies. I will graduate in May 2024 and work full-time as a software
    developer.</p>

    <h4 class="my-2">Skills</h4>

    <p>I am experienced in full-stack web development and systems
    programming. I am proficient in Linux and C/C++, Python, Javascript
    and SQL languages. I have worked with several web frameworks like
    Node.js, Flask.py and Rails. I love problem-solving and being the
    most efficient version of myself. My workflow uses neovim, tmux and
    i3 on Arch linux.</p>

    <h4 class="my-2">Work Experience</h4>

    <p>I have done internships at multiple companies and startups. I
    initially worked as a web developer at Aspire where I built a custom
    Node website for an online assessment form. I also worked in a DevOps
    role at an AI startup where I built a Grafana dashboard for
    monitoring server health. I most recently worked at Amazon, where I
    worked in the Goodreads team in San Francisco. Presently, I am a
    course assistant at my university for CS340, where we teach about
    computer systems and C programming.</p>

    <h4 class="my-2">Hobbies</h4>

    <p>I am a trained musician with my primary instrument being the
    electric guitar. I have been playing guitar for over a decade. For
    fun, I enjoy playing sports like badminton and hiking.</p>
